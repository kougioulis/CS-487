__function__ DT-AGENT(_percept_) __returns__ an _action_  
&emsp;__persistent__: _belief\_state_, probabilistic beliefs about the current state of the world  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;_action_, the agent's action  

&emsp;update _belief\_state_ based on _action_ and _percept_  
&emsp;calculate outcome probabilities for actions,  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;given action descriptions and current _belief\_state_  
&emsp;select _action_ with highest expected utility  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;given probabilities of outcomes and utility information  
&emsp;__return__ _action_
